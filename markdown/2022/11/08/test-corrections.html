<ul>
  <li>I got this question wrong because I didn’t read the code snipped properly. I thought it said y&gt;0 and thus assumed that it would evaluate to true and print 3*7 = 21.</li>
  <li>Answer C is correct because the condition states (x&lt;10 and y&lt;0). Since y is 3 and not less than 0, the else condition evaluates printing 7/3 which comes out to 2.</li>
  <li>I can watch 3.5 daily videos 1-3 to learn this concept.</li>

<h2 id="question-12">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-12" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 12</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70538669/200734395-4d53a03b-fad7-4cbc-afa5-4ca443745401.png" alt="image"></p>

<ul>
  <li>I misinterpreted the code snippet and didn’t notice that incrementing k by two would result in letters being skipped.</li>
  <li>Answer C is correct the value of k starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 each time around. This means that k will be 1,3,5,7, and 9 over the loop. This means that every other letter is outputted resulting in optr.</li>
  <li>I can watch 2.7 and 4.3 daily videos to learn this concept.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-13">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-13" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 13</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70538669/200734426-f57b9947-8087-48bd-a606-e6ed2de3c147.png" alt="image"></p>

<ul>
  <li>This answer is incorrect because the code outputs k and not arr[k]. Therefore it is the index that is printed and not the value of the list at that index.</li>
  <li>Answer B is corrected because it is the index that is printed whenever a value is greater than the following value. Therefore, the output must start as 0 because that is the index.</li>
  <li>I can watch 6.4 daily vides 1-3 to learn this concept.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-21">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-21" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 21</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70538669/200734465-12351ab2-0fd8-409e-b061-8da0398ace1d.png" alt="image"></p>

<ul>
  <li>This answer is incorrect due to the type of for loop. I did not notice the prescence of an enhanced for loop. Therefore, num is not an index but an actual value in the list. subtracting val from row[num] would not be accurate because num is not an index.</li>
  <li>Answer D is correct because it recognizes that num is a value in the list so all that must be done is subtract val from num.</li>
  <li>I can watch 2.9 and 8.2 videos 1-3 to learn this concept.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-23">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-23" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 23</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70538669/200734504-a3f6a8fa-3640-4395-b66c-17d0defb6f44.png" alt="image"></p>

<ul>
  <li>I got this question wrong because I couldn’t comprehend the complex code and figure out what function it was accomplishing.</li>
  <li>Answer B is correct because the elements that start with B are being appended the opposite side of the list.</li>
  <li>I can watch 2.7 videos 1-3 as well as 7.4 video 1 to learn this concept.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-34">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-34" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 34</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70538669/200734555-2d785b4d-98da-4ec4-ad50-658bc92cc674.png" alt="image"></p>

<ul>
  <li>I got this question wrong because I did not realize that x and y were private variables and thus cannot be accessed the way they are being accessed in option 3. Therefore, option 3 is not valid.</li>
  <li>Answer B is correct because 2 is the only valid option. The center and radius are defined by (a,b), while options 1 and 3 do not work.</li>
  <li>I can watch 5.2 daily videos 1-3 to learn this concept.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-39">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-39" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 39</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70538669/200734585-eb8a802a-f5fc-48d1-a2f9-08e5e4a78601.png" alt="image"></p>

<ul>
  <li>I got this wrong because I did not read code properly. I did not notice that it was recur(recur(x)) and therefore thought the code ended after one run and returned 18.</li>
  <li>Option D is correct because recur is repeated until recur(n) is a value under 10. This occurs when n=8 and n*2 = 16 is returned.</li>
  <li>I can watch 10.1 videos 1 and 2 to learn this concept.</li>
</ul>
