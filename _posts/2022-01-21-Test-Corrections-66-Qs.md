- I got this question wrong because I didn't read the answer choice properly. I did not notice that it had a -1 attached to the animals.length and ignored the rest of the options.
- Answer A is correct because the loop must iterate through the entire list and stop when the index i is equal to the length of the list, since indexes start from 0.

- I got this problem wrong because I didn't notice that a1 could not be accessed outside its class due to the private keyword. Furthermore, i neglected that inheritance allowed methodA to be accessed in class B.
- Answer D is correct because methodB can't be used in the parent class in which it doesn't exist. Furthermore, a1 can't be accessed in class B.

- I got this wrong because I didn't realize that the original snippet was iterating through the number of columns in line 5. I assumed that it was iterating for rows and therefore needed to be changed to arr.length. 
- Answer C is correct because row can only be iterated through an array, not a column.

- This answer is incorrect because I didn't read and interpret the boolean values properly in the code snippet. I should have used sample values to see if the same result was achieved. 
- Answer E is correct because it recognizes that the opposite of the given expression would print cat and uses that in the if condition.

- This answer is incorrect because I once again did not take the time to evalulate the booleans myself with sample values. I also did not think to apply deMorgans law. 
- Answer A is correct because it utilizes deMorgans law.

## Question 20

- I got this question wrong because I did not notice the difference between < and <=. Furthermore, i didn't notice that one of the snippets prints even numbers. 
- Answer E is correct because the original snippet only prints odd numbers up till 7. While this loops k limit has been changed to 8, it has no impact since k is incremented by 2 and therefore prints the same.

## Question 24

- I got this question wrong because I did not realize that the <= in the first for loop would result in the loop going to an index that did not exist if a 0 was not found. The only array in which this applies was D.  
- Option D is correct because it was the only array in which there was no 0, meaning the loop would have continued past arr.length-1 to a nonexistent index.

- I got this wrong because I did not realize that the option i select would result in the count being reset to 0 before being compared to the previous count. 
- Option E is correct because it allows for the count to be compared to the max and then reset to avoid overcounting.
