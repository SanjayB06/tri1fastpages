## Study Plan
### Capture information that will grow to 10 CB Units
- Daily CB videos
  - Organize jupyter based on units w/ key code segments
- Practice AP MCs and FRQs, especially near April
- Collegeboard work and practice

As AP Test date gets closer I will:
- Take practice tests to determine strong and weak concepts
  - Review old material and search for new resources
- Take practice MCs
- Take practice FRQs
- Take full lenght, sit down, timed AP exams
